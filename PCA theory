PCA is essentially a method that reduces the dimension of the feature space in such a way that new variables are orthogonal to each other 
(i.e. they are independent or not correlated)

Before applying PCA, we scale our data such that each feature has unit variance. 
This is necessary because fitting algorithms highly depends on the scaling of the features. 

Here we use the StandardScalermodule 
for scaling the features individually
StandardScalersubtracts the mean from each features and then scale to unit variance

Now weâ€™re ready to apply PCA on this scaled data-set. 
We start as before with StandardScaler, where we instantiate, then fit and finally transform the scaled data. 
While applying PCA you can mention how many principal components you want to keep
