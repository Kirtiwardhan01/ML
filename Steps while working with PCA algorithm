#For regression and classification based problems
#While working with PCA algorithm, separate X variables from the target Y variable (Say bf_x, bf_y)
#Then x_scaled = scaler.(fit_tranform bf_x) and then 
# apply pca.fit_tranform(x_scaled)
#based on the variance ratio select the no. of features that add upto 95% variance
#then using the suitable algorithm build the model and predict the values
#convert it into pandas dataframe 
#find the intercept, coefficients, score, (regression) and confusion matrix (classification)
#accuracy of the model
