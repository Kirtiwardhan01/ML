Overfitting
A common problem in machine learning is overfitting: 
Overfitting happens when a model overlearns from the training data to the point that it starts picking up 
idiosyncrasies that arenâ€™t representative of patterns in the real world. 
This becomes especially problematic as you make your model increasingly complex. 
Underfitting is a related issue where your model is not complex enough to capture the underlying trend in the data
